I am currently an Assistant Professor in the Department of Biosystems and Agricultural Engineering at [Oklahoma State University](https://agriculture.okstate.edu/departments-programs/engineering/). My research focus is on using data and data science (including machine learning) for water resource science and engineering. 

### My background
I completed my BS and MS degrees at [Brigham Young University](https://www.byu.edu) in Provo, Utah. With Dr. Daniel Ames as my adviser, I worked on research centered on data standards during my MS degree. I did my Ph.D. at the [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu), in Charlottesville, VA with Dr. Jonathan Goodall. As a Ph.D. student, I studied crowd-sourced datasets, machine learning models, and active stormwater systems to address coastal, urban flooding. 

### My family
I really enjoy my research -- I love learning new things. That said, the prime environment for my learning and teaching has been with my family. 

### Other interests
I love to play frisbee, ride my bike (esp. with my family), be outside in general, and bake sourdough bread and pizza.
