I am a Ph.D. student at the [University of Virginia](http://www.virginia.edu). My research focus, and the focus of [our group led by Dr. Jonathan Goodall](https://uvahydroinformatics.org), is on hydroinformatics. In my mind, hydroinformatics is the intersection of computer science, data science, and water resources engineering. I love studying hydroinformatics because I am passionate about computer programming and about better understanding and addressing water resources challenges.

# My academic journey
I completed my BS and MS degrees at [Brigham Young University](https://www.byu.edu) in Provo, Utah. With Dr. Dan Ames as my adviser, I worked on research centered on data standards during my MS degree. As a Ph.D. student, my focus has been on emerging datasets (i.e., citizen science and crowd-sourced), models (i.e., machine learning models), and approaches (i.e., active stormwater systems) to address water resources challenges, especially coastal, urban flooding.
