The most impactful learning and teaching experiences have come from my family - from being a son, a husband, and a father. A few examples of some "courses" that I've taken (and still working on): 
* From my parents, I've learned the importance of hard work and sacrifice 
* From my wife, I've learned to be more honest, genuine, and organized
* From my son, I've learned to really pay attention, to focus on the moment, and to have fun
